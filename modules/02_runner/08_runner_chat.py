"""
08_runner_chat.py

Demonstrates managing multi-turn conversations (chat threads) with Runner.

Features demonstrated:
- Running an initial turn with an agent.
- Using RunResultBase.to_input_list() to get conversation history.
- Appending new user messages to the history for follow-up turns.
- Running subsequent turns with the updated history.
- Using RunConfig.group_id to link traces for a conversation thread.

Based on: https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/running_agents/#conversationschat-threads

Environment variables:
    - OPENROUTER_API_KEY: Required for OpenRouter API access.
