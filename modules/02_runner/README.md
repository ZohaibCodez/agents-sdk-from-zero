# ‚ö° 02_runner ‚Äî Agent Execution & RunResult Exploration

_A hands-on exploration of the OpenAI Agents SDK Runner, RunResult object properties, and agent execution patterns._

---

## üìö About This Module

This folder explores the **OpenAI Agents SDK Runner** - the core execution engine that brings agents to life. Here, I dive deep into agent execution patterns, RunResult object exploration, error handling, and understanding the complete lifecycle of agent runs. Each script demonstrates practical execution scenarios with detailed property analysis.

## üîç RunResult Object Deep Dive

The `01_run.py` script provides a comprehensive exploration of the RunResult object, including:

### Core Properties
- **`final_output`**: The agent's final response
- **`raw_responses`**: All model responses during execution
- **`input`**: The original user input
- **`new_items`**: Items added during execution

### Context & State
- **`context_wrapper`**: Execution context and state
- **`last_agent`**: The final agent in the execution chain
- **`last_response_id`**: Unique identifier for the last response

### Guardrails & Safety
- **`input_guardrail_results`**: Input validation results
- **`output_guardrail_results`**: Output safety check results

### Utility Methods
- **`to_input_list()`**: Convert result to input list format
- **`final_output_as(str)`**: Type-safe output conversion
