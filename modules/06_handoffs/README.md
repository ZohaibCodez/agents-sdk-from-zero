# 06_handoffs ‚Äî Advanced Agent Handoffs & Input Filtering

This module demonstrates advanced handoff patterns, input filtering, and callback mechanisms using the OpenAI Agents SDK. It covers multi-agent orchestration, privacy-preserving handoffs, structured data transfer, and recommended prompt engineering for robust, real-world agent systems.

---

## üöÄ Learning Goals
- Understand multi-agent handoff orchestration and routing
- Implement custom callbacks for handoff events
- Use structured data (Pydantic models) for handoff inputs
- Apply input filters for privacy, redaction, and summarization
- Engineer recommended prompts for better agent handoff understanding
- Explore robust error handling and professional output formatting

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required for most scripts)
   - `MISTRAL_API_KEY` (required for 04_handoff_input_filter_basics.py)
   - See root `.env.example` for details

2. **Run a demo script:**
   ```bash
   # Example: Run the basic handoff demo
   python modules/06_handoffs/01_basic_handoffs.py
   ```

3. **Explore other scripts:**
   ```bash
   python modules/06_handoffs/02_handoffs_with_callbacks.py
   python modules/06_handoffs/03_handoff_inputs.py
   python modules/06_handoffs/04_handoff_input_filter_basics.py
   python modules/06_handoffs/05_handoff_input_filters.py
   python modules/06_handoffs/06_recommended_prompts.py
   ```

## üß© Key Concepts

- **Agent Handoffs:** Seamless transfer of context and control between specialized agents.
- **Callbacks:** Custom functions triggered on handoff events for logging, side effects, or data processing.
- **Input Filters:** Functions to redact, summarize, or transform context before handoff (privacy, compliance, clarity).
- **Structured Inputs:** Use of Pydantic models for validating and structuring handoff data.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Recommended prompt patterns for clarity, transfer rationale, and agent expectations.
