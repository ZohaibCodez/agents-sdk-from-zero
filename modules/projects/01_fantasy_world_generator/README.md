# 🏰 Fantasy World Generator

## 🎯 Project Overview

A sophisticated multi-agent system that creates comprehensive fantasy worlds by orchestrating specialized agents. This project demonstrates advanced patterns in the OpenAI Agents SDK, including agents-as-tools, streaming responses, and complex workflow management.

## ✨ What This Project Demonstrates

### 🧠 **Advanced Concepts Learned:**
- **Agents as Tools**: Converting agents into reusable tools
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple specialized agents
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time output with event handling
- **Complex Workflows**: Managing multi-step creative processes
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management in async operations

### 🛠️ **Technical Patterns:**
- Agent composition and tool conversion
- Async streaming with event processing
- Structured creative content generation
- Tool chaining and workflow management

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
StoryMaster Agent (Coordinator)
├── Magic System Agent → Magic Tool
├── World Map Agent → Map Tool  
├── Lore Agent → Lore Tool
└── Random Creature Generator
```

## 🚀 Features

- **🎪 Magic System Generation**: Creates unique magical frameworks
- **🗺️ World Map Creation**: Generates detailed fantasy geography
- **📜 Ancient Lore**: Crafts mysterious myths and legends
- **🐉 Creature Generation**: Adds magical beings to the world
- **🎭 Streaming Output**: Real-time world building experience

## 📝 Code Highlights

### Agent-to-Tool Conversion
```python
magic_tool = magic_agent.as_tool(
    tool_name="generate_magic_system",
    tool_description="Generates a unique magic system for a fantasy world.",
)
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
```python
story_master: Agent = Agent(
    name="StoryMasterAgent",
    instructions="Fantasy world builder assistant...",
    tools=[magic_tool, map_tool, lore_tool, generate_random_creature],
    model=model,
)
```

### Streaming Event Handling
```python
async for event in result.stream_events():
    if event.type == "tool_call_item":
        print(f"-- Tool was called")
    elif event.type == "tool_call_output_item":
        print(f"-- Tool output: {event.item.output}")
```

## 🎮 How to Run

```bash
# From project directory
uv run modules/projects/01_fantasy_world_generator/main.py
```

## 📊 Example Output
