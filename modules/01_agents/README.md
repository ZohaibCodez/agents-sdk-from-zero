# üöÄ 01_agents ‚Äî Agent Fundamentals & Context Handling

_A hands-on, example-driven exploration of the OpenAI Agents SDK's core agent patterns, context management, structured outputs, and advanced orchestration._

## üìö About This Module

This folder is part of my journey to master the **OpenAI Agents SDK**. Here, I experiment with foundational agent concepts, context passing, advanced instruction patterns, structured outputs, and advanced agent orchestration. Each script and notebook is a step in my learning-by-doing approach, with code, explanations, and real outputs.

## üèÅ Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:**  
> - Python environment with dependencies installed (`uv sync`)  
> - `.env` file with your API key(s) in the project root

### Run a Basic Agent Example

```bash
uv run modules/01_agents/01_hello_agent.py
```

### Run a Context-Aware Agent Example

```bash
uv run modules/01_agents/04_agent_context.py
```

### Explore Interactive Notebooks

Open the notebooks in your favorite Jupyter environment:

- `03_agents_instructions.ipynb`
- `05_immutable_context.ipynb`

### Structured Output & Advanced Examples

```bash
uv run modules/01_agents/06_structure.py
```

### Non-Strict Output Example

```bash
uv run modules/01_agents/07_non_strict_output_type.py
```

### Advanced Agent Features & Orchestration

```bash
uv run modules/01_agents/08_advanced_agent_features.py
```
