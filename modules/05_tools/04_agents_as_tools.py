Agents as Tools Demo - OpenAI Agents SDK

This module demonstrates how to use agents as tools within other agents.
It showcases:
- Creating specialized agents for different tasks
- Converting agents to tools using as_tool() method
- Orchestrating multiple agents through a main agent
- Content creation and editing workflows
- Error handling and graceful failure
- Multi-agent collaboration patterns

The demo implements a content editing system with specialized agents for poetry,
story writing, summarization, and grammar correction.

Environment variables:
    - OPENROUTER_API_KEY: Required for OpenRouter API access.
