Multi-Agent Orchestration Demo for Fitness Planning

This module demonstrates a professional, educational, and robust multi-agent orchestration system for fitness planning using the OpenAI Agents SDK. It features:
- Multiple specialized agents (workout, diet, supplement, orchestrator)
- Tool usage and handoff between agents
- Robust error handling with visually distinct output
- Comprehensive docstrings and inline comments for educational clarity
- Environment variable: GEMINI_API_KEY (required)
