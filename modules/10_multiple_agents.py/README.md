# 10_multiple_agents ‚Äî Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

This module demonstrates advanced multi-agent orchestration patterns using the OpenAI Agents SDK. It covers LLM-driven, code-driven, and hybrid orchestration strategies for real-world domains like fitness planning and university tasks, with robust error handling, structured outputs, and educational code.

---

## üöÄ Learning Goals

- Understand LLM-driven, code-driven, and hybrid orchestration strategies
- Build and chain specialized agents for complex workflows
- Use structured output models for planning, evaluation, and task routing
- Implement robust error handling and fallback logic in multi-agent systems
- Analyze and compare orchestration strategies for real-world domains

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required for 01 and 02)
   - `MISTRAL_API_KEY` (required for 03)
   - See root `.env.example` for details

2. **Run a demo script:**
   ```bash
   # LLM-driven multi-agent orchestration (fitness)
   python modules/10_multiple_agents.py/01_llm_orchestrated_agents.py

   # Code-driven orchestration (university tasks)
   python modules/10_multiple_agents.py/02_code_orchestrated_agents.py

   # Hybrid orchestration with dynamic strategy
   python modules/10_multiple_agents.py/03_hybrid_orchestration.py
   ```

## üß© Key Concepts

- **LLM-Orchestrated Agents:** Use LLMs to route, chain, and coordinate agent workflows
- **Code-Orchestrated Agents:** Use Python logic for explicit agent orchestration and control
- **Hybrid Orchestration:** Combine LLM and code strategies for adaptive, robust workflows
- **Structured Outputs:** Use Pydantic models for planning, evaluation, and task routing
- **Fallback & Error Handling:** Build resilient systems with robust error and fallback logic

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment & Configuration

- Requires valid API keys for Gemini (Google) and/or Mistral (OpenRouter)
- See `.env.example` in project root for all required/optional variables
- Scripts use `dotenv` for environment loading
