# üöÄ 01_agents ‚Äî Agent Fundamentals & Context Handling

_A hands-on, example-driven exploration of the OpenAI Agents SDK's core agent patterns, context management, structured outputs, advanced orchestration, and tool behavior control._

## üìö About This Module

This folder is part of my journey to master the **OpenAI Agents SDK**. Here, I experiment with foundational agent concepts, context passing, advanced instruction patterns, structured outputs, advanced agent orchestration, and tool behavior control. Each script and notebook is a step in my learning-by-doing approach, with code, explanations, and real outputs.
