# ‚ö° 02_runner ‚Äî Agent Execution & RunResult Exploration

_A hands-on exploration of the OpenAI Agents SDK Runner, RunResult object properties, and agent execution patterns._

---

## üìö About This Module

This folder explores the **OpenAI Agents SDK Runner** - the core execution engine that brings agents to life. Here, I dive deep into agent execution patterns, RunResult object exploration, error handling, and understanding the complete lifecycle of agent runs. Each script demonstrates practical execution scenarios with detailed property analysis.
